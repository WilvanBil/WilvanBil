TLDR: If you're getting a **400 Bad Request** error with **Azure OpenAIâ€™s ChatCompletion API**, and thereâ€™s **no useful error message**, try adding **custom logging and retry policies** to your client setup.  

Here's a **quick fix** using a custom `PipelinePolicy` to log detailed request/response information:  

### **Custom Logging Middleware for Better Error Visibility**

```csharp
public class CustomLoggingPolicy : PipelinePolicy
{
    public override void Process(PipelineMessage message, IReadOnlyList<PipelinePolicy> pipeline, int currentIndex)
    {
        ProcessNext(message, pipeline, currentIndex);
    }

    public override async ValueTask ProcessAsync(PipelineMessage message, IReadOnlyList<PipelinePolicy> pipeline, int currentIndex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Sending Request to {message.Request.Uri}");

        await ProcessNextAsync(message, pipeline, currentIndex);

        if (message.Response?.IsError == true)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Request to {message.Request.Uri}, " +
                $"ReasonPhrase: {message.Response.ReasonPhrase} " +
                $"ResponseContent: {message.Response.Content}");
        }
    }
}
```

### **Custom Retry Policy for Rate Limiting**

```csharp
public class CustomClientRetryPolicy : ClientRetryPolicy
{
    protected override async ValueTask<bool> ShouldRetryAsync(PipelineMessage message, Exception? exception)
    {
        if (message.Response.Status == (int)HttpStatusCode.TooManyRequests)
        {
            return false;
        }
        return await base.ShouldRetryAsync(message, exception);
    }
}
```

### **Apply Policies to `AzureOpenAIClientOptions`**

```csharp
AzureOpenAIClientOptions clientOptions = new();
clientOptions.AddPolicy(new CustomLoggingPolicy(), PipelinePosition.BeforeTransport);
clientOptions.RetryPolicy = new CustomClientRetryPolicy();

AzureOpenAIClient azureOpenAiClient = new(
    new Uri("https://your-openai-instance.openai.azure.com/"),
    new DefaultAzureCredential(),
    clientOptions
);
```

This should help **surface useful error messages** and **prevent excessive retries** when encountering rate limits.

## **The Journey: Debugging OpenAI 400 Errors**  

### **My Specific Issue: Rate Limits (But I Tried Everything First)**

When I first encountered the **400 Bad Request** error in **Azure OpenAIâ€™s ChatCompletion API**, I had **no clue** what was wrong. The response contained **zero useful details**, which made debugging frustrating.

At first, I considered multiple possible causes and tested each one before finally discovering that **rate limits** were the real issue. Hereâ€™s how I approached debugging:

1. **Checked API Key and Authentication** âœ…  
   - Used `ApiKeyCredential` to ensure I wasnâ€™t using incorrect credentials.  
   - Verified that my **deployment name** matched what I set up in Azure OpenAI.
2. **Validated Request Payload** âœ…  
   - Manually tested different parameters (`MaxTokens`, `Temperature`, `TopP`) to see if invalid values were causing the issue.  
   - Used **Azureâ€™s AI Studio (`ai.azure.com`)** sample code to compare it to my code. ![sample code]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/status-400-on-chatcompletion/samplecode.png)
3. **Suspected Rate Limits (Bingo! ðŸŽ¯)**  
   - After exhausting all other options, I started logging request details.  
   - Turns out, **Azure sometimes returns 400 instead of 429 for rate limits!**  
   - Implementing **custom logging and retry policies** (as shown earlier) finally helped identify the root cause.

### **Debugging Journey: Searching for the Solution**

I searched through **the README, official documentation, and wiki articles**, but they didnâ€™t provide a clear answer. Eventually, I stumbled upon a **GitHub issue** that described symptoms similar to mine.  

Thatâ€™s when I found [this comment](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/issues/47280#issuecomment-2518556663), which proposed adding a **custom logging policy** to reveal more details about the API response. This helped me confirm the issue was related to **rate limiting**.

## **Lessons Learned**

- **Always log request/response details** to debug issues.
- **Rate limits can return misleading errors**â€”watch for `400` that might be `429`.
- **Azure OpenAI SDK lacks detailed error handling**â€”adding a **Custom Logging Policy** helps.
- **Check AI Studio (`ai.azure.com`) for payload validation** before coding.

---

## **Future Improvements**

- Automate **rate limit handling** with **dynamic backoff** instead of outright failing on 429 errors.
- Improve **error messages in SDK** (maybe even contribute to the official repo ðŸ¤”).
- Experiment with **batching requests** to reduce token consumption.

## **Final Thoughts**

Debugging **Azure OpenAIâ€™s 400 errors** was frustrating, but this journey reinforced a crucial lesson:  

ðŸ“Œ **When APIs donâ€™t give you useful error messages, build your own debugging tools.**  

If you're struggling with similar issues, try implementing a **Custom Logging & Retry Policy**â€”it made a world of difference for me.  

If youâ€™ve faced weird OpenAI API issues, Iâ€™d love to hear about them.
