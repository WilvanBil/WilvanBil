Did you just try pressing `Ctrl+K`? If so, you owe me a follow on [GitHub](https://github.com/WilvanBil). But seriously, let's talk about why this shortcut is amazing.

## Finding Docs Shouldn’t Feel Like a Side Quest  

I love [writing](https://blog.willyal.de/documentation/2025/01/29/why-i-love-writing-documentation.html) great documentation, but I **dislike searching** documentation. You know the drill—you're in the middle of coding, and you need to look up a method or a configuration. You open the official docs, click through a few sections, scroll endlessly and somehow still don’t get the right result. So what do you do? You **Google it instead**.  

That was me—until I found `Ctrl+K`.

## What is `Ctrl+K` Search?  

The feature you see when pressing `Ctrl+K` on some websites is called:  

- **Site-wide Search**  
- **Command Palette**  

It’s a fast way to find pages, documentation, and commands **without clicking through menus**.  
It works by indexing the entire site’s content, allowing for near-instant retrieval as you type. Instead of waiting for a page reload, results update in real-time, just like an IDE’s symbol search.

### Why should you care?  

Because **nobody enjoys digging through dropdowns** just to find one page. Microsoft has vast amounts of documentation that regularly gets updated, but it lacks one feature that I miss—`Ctrl+K`.  

For example, say I want to search **[Azure OpenAI SDK Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/overview/azure/ai.openai-readme?view=azure-dotnet)** for how to work with `ChatClient`. You’d think I could **just search for it**, right?  

Well… not quite.  

![MicrosoftFilter]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ctrl+k/MicrosoftFilter.png)  
*I can filter by title on the left.*  

![MicrosoftSearch]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ctrl+k/MicrosoftSearch.png)  
*I can click the search button on the top right.*  

Each of these requires extra steps—moving your mouse, clicking, typing, pressing enter, and then scrolling through results. That’s **five steps** before I even get to what I need.  

Compare this to how I navigate **[MassTransit](https://masstransit.io/)** docs…

## The First Time I Used `Ctrl+K`  

The first time I saw a `Ctrl+K` search bar was in the **[MassTransit](https://masstransit.io/)** docs.  

I was deep in the trenches, trying to figure out why my saga wasn’t behaving (as all sagas do). So I made my way to the **MassTransit** site and noticed this in the menu:  

![MassTransitSearch]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ctrl+k/MassTransitSearch.png)  

Don’t panic if you see a `⌘` instead of `Ctrl`. That’s macOS pretending it's special. At this point, I was already mentally preparing for a deep dive into the docs, scanning the navigation sidebar, maybe hitting `Ctrl+F` and manually searching. But then… I saw it. Out of curiosity, I hit Ctrl+K, typed "saga," and within seconds, the exact page I needed popped up. No Google. No Stack Overflow rabbit holes. Just the answer. After that, I started noticing `Ctrl+K` everywhere.  

I've seen it on many different sites.

## Why I Use `Ctrl+K` Over Traditional Search  

I'm used to relying on Google and Stack Overflow, but more and more, I find myself turning to official documentation first.  
Instead of searching Google for **“MassTransit JobConsumer”**, just press `Ctrl+K` → type "JobConsumer" and get instant, relevant results. The first time, you’ll still need to navigate to the site, but once you’re there, searching for different topics becomes effortless.

Why it’s useful:  

- **Faster:** Results appear immediately  
- **More relevant:** Suggests related topics  
- **No extra navigation:** No need to manually browse docs  
- **More sites are adopting it:** Once you start using it, you’ll miss it everywhere else

## IDE Shortcuts Do the Same Thing—So Why Not Docs?  

If you’re a developer, you already expect fast navigation.  
We don’t **scroll through files manually**, we use shortcuts like these:  

| Shortcut | Feature | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `Ctrl+K` (Web) | Site-wide search | Search docs & pages |
| `Ctrl+T` (VS) | Go to Symbol | Find classes/methods/files |
| `Ctrl+P` (VS Code) | Quick Open | Open files quickly |
| `Ctrl+Shift+P` (VS Code) | Command Palette | Execute VS Code commands |

If you’re already using `Ctrl+T` in **Visual Studio** or `Ctrl+P` in **VS Code** to jump to files instantly, why wouldn’t you want the same for documentation?  

![VisualStudioSearchResults]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ctrl+k/VisualStudioSearchResults.png)  

![VisualStudioCodeSearchResults]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ctrl+k/VisualStudioCodeSearchResults.png)  

I used to press `Ctrl+Shift+F` like a chump to find code, but `Ctrl+T`/`Ctrl+P` lets me jump straight to what I need.  
**Same energy as `Ctrl+K` on websites.**

## Final Thoughts  

If you’ve ever been frustrated digging through documentation, `Ctrl+K` search is a game-changer. Instead of endless clicks, dropdowns, and Google detours, you get instant, relevant results—right where you need them.

- If you maintain documentation, add `Ctrl+K` support.
- If you browse documentation, start using it.

And if you ever catch yourself clicking through menus, ask why the site doesn’t have it yet.

Meanwhile, I’ll be Googling how to add `Ctrl+K` to this blog.
Oh wait… should I just use `Ctrl+K`?
