# Hey there! 👋

I'm a **.NET enthusiast** who believes in clean code, loves mentoring, and is currently diving deep into AI development.

## 🚀 What I'm Up To

- **Dabbling in AI with .NET** - Exploring how AI is changing the way we develop software
- **Writing & Sharing** - Check out my latest thoughts at [blog.willyal.de](https://blog.willyal.de/)

## 🛠️ My Stack

**Languages & Frameworks:**

- .NET (my love ❤️)
- A lil bit of Angular
- A lil bit of a lil bit of React
- Markdown (for all the documentation)
- Mermaid diagrams (because I love a good diagram)

**Tools I Live By:**

- Visual Studio & VS Code
- LM Studio
- Good old Notepad (never underestimate the classics)
- DevToys

## 📝 My Documentation Philosophy

> I write documentation so I don't need to remember the documentation. This frees up mental space for AI experimentation, which I'll later document for future AI experimentation.

It's a beautiful cycle. 🔄
