## 🚀 I Love Ctrl+K  

Did you just try pressing **Ctrl+K**? If so, you owe me a follow on [GitHub](https://github.com/WilvanBil). But seriously, let's talk about why this shortcut is amazing.

## 🔍 What is Ctrl+K Search?  

The feature you see when pressing **Ctrl+K** on some websites is called:  

- **Site-wide Search**  
- **Command Palette**  
- **OmniSearch**  

👉 It’s a fast way to find pages, documentation, and commands **without clicking through menus**.  

## 📚 Examples of Ctrl+K in Action  

Many popular frameworks and tools support this:  

### **1️⃣ MassTransit**

## 🎯 Why is Ctrl+K So Powerful?  

Instead of searching Google for **“MassTransit JobConsumer”**, just press **Ctrl+K → type "JobConsumer"** and get instant, relevant results.  

🔹 **Why I love it:**  
✅ **Fast:** No waiting, results appear instantly.  
✅ **Relevant:** It suggests related topics you didn’t think of.  
✅ **Efficient:** No need to navigate through docs manually.  
✅ **Standardized:** More sites are adopting this.  

## 🔍 Similar Features in IDEs  

This isn’t just for websites—**our IDEs do it too!**  

| Shortcut | Feature | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Ctrl+K (Web)** | Site-wide search | Search docs & pages |
| **Ctrl+T (VS)** | Go to Symbol | Find classes/methods/files |
| **Ctrl+P (VS Code)** | Quick Open | Open files quickly |
| **Ctrl+Shift+P (VS Code)** | Command Palette | Execute VS Code commands |

🔹 **Example: Visual Studio**

I used to press **Ctrl+Shift+F** like a chump to find code, but **Ctrl+T** lets me jump straight to what I need. **Same energy as Ctrl+K on websites.**
