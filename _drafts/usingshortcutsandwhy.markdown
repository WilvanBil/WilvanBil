Lately I've been into Age of Empires II again and like the avid perfectionist (not perfectionist, use a different term, i dont like it) I want to be good at the game. I tried to play StarCraft II competitively back in the day so a lot of those skills transfer to AoE:II. You need to understand your macro (building economy, raising an army) together with micro (handling encounters, scouting), they're all beautifully glued together with the usage of hotkeys. So I set up my own personel hotkey profile to match the game mechanics to my style and it got me thinking on how I use hotkeys in my day to day work when coding, reviewing, editing.

This is not a blog about randomly listing up shortcuts and telling you to use them. This is about you learning how to recognize where and when you should be using them. (all the time). (maybe not set the focus on what the reader should do, but what I did).

First and formost list up all applications that you use in your day to day job
second, list up the tasks that you do when clicking. this is the hard one because it's about recognizing your habits from an outsider perspective. Here are some tips (insert tips.)

OS first, alt tab, open a terminal, open your IDE? open Linkedin on windows(add this fun fact)

IDE (visual studio)
IDE Visual Studio Code
Your db tool
your Kubernetes tool

Atlassian Software site?
Azure DevOps site?

Add why this is beneficial?

Always add in the beginning the no nonsense straight to the point explanation what reader should do.
Any other sections that I should add?
