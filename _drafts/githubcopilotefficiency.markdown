Don't use copilot to find and replace. Do NOT use copilot for find and replace. DO NOT USE COPILOT FOR FIND AND REPLACE.
Some things are better done by copilot, other things you should not let copilot do. One of those things is find and replace.
Use the tools that visual studio offers you to do those. You can ctrl shift h to find replace stuff in your solution/project/document/selection. You can ctrl . for smart replace or applies on specific information/warning/error messages. This doesn't cost any tokens. It only costs a lil bit of manual intervention.

What are other stuff that you should not do with copilot? Maybe there's also some things that can be done more efficiently.
I think with copilot you need to find the sweet spot between being specific and being vague to find the best results. If you're being too specific. You might as well implement it yourself. If you're being too vague, you might spend a lot more tokens on a change.

Moving interfaces to it's own file for example
