I love ctrl+k.Now If you tried to ctrl+k just now you owe me a follow on Github https://github.com/WilvanBil
The term that I have found on the internet is called Site-wide search.

It's a way to quickly look up pages in websites when you're looking for certain documentation
MassTransit has it, Marten has it, Chili cream has it
(add screenshots)

It's such a cool, easy (and suprisingly fast) way to look up stuff.

We also have this in our IDE's .
Visual Studio 
VS Code

Please, if you have a website with a lot of documentation, tutorials, or guides. Try implementing these and encourage visitors to use the ctrl+k to search through this.
