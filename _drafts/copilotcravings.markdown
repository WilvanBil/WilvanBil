I used to dabble in AI Q&A style, if I had a question regarding something specific, I'd ask AI about it. Later this evolved into me using AI to brainstorm about bigger ideas. I was always very critical with the output and always made sure my instruction prompt was as restrictive as I could make it without it being overlyprotected.

Then came the agents. And agents changed the game for me, a simple .NET developer.
In my head the classic developer vanished. And those who don't adapt, will perish. Seems very shakespearean and dark and scary but that's the feeling I felt.

A refactor task that would have taken me a couple of days would have been done by an AI in an hour with xml comments, updated section in the README.md and a dedicated file in the `/docs` folder.
An example is replacing NUnit unit tests with XUnit. Also throw out FluentAssertions because of pricing.

I thought using copilot to replace nunit with xunit would be faster and simpler.
It seems like it's not.

In the near future companies will save on developers because developers will learn how to effectively wield copilot to write code. This also has its downside. Asking copilot to do stuff isn't free. This will cost tokens. And soon the average developer will hit the token limit and it's back to manual executing. There will be two followups.

1. People will ask their customer or employer for more tokens.
2. People will learn how to spend their tokens effectively.
   The people that will focus on the second point will be the ones who'll adapt. So then it becomes a race to be to most optimized prompt developer to show your worth. (why so dramatic Willy..)

To help you with this you will have to study and learn and be strict. Know your fundamentals, know your best practices, be up to date with all the frameworks that you use. That's where you will spend most of your time. AI isn't strong enough yet to know better. This is where you should focus on.

Hold on. These stuff are stuff that were always relevent? Even before AI. The people who know their coding best practices and keep up to date are the ones that will grow. Huh.. Hwat about that... So as one .NET developer to another, learn to adapt. use the tools that we got to be better. Some people believe this is going to be a phase and it will pass, like blockchain, big data, IOT. But this is the first paradigm shift that I think will really affect us developers.

The time you spend before writing the code will now go to reviewing the code and learning better fundamentals and more importantly, sharing this with your junior colleagues so they will adapt good habits and be an even better developer in the future.
I don't know what my point was here. This will change, but for now I'm trying to adapt the best I can.
