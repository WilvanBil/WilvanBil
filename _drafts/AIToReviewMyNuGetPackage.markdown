I will write down what I experienced with using Github Copilot on my NuGet package. It should follow a progress.
The package itself has been in stasis. It's been since (isnert date) that I have made an update. So I will ask the copilot to review it.
Why? Because I'm curious. This was code that I have written myself, with only Google as my aid. I'm nervous to see what copilot will find.
I hope it will like my documentation. I'm really proud of that part.
Maybe it will like my tests? Maybe not? Why am I nervous?

_Document progress_
Before we ask questions we need to set it up with the correct prompt.
So I will use the prompt from Microsft themselves.
Maybe I will tweak it with my personal touch, as in xml documentation. Make sure the correct steps are documented as well in the readme.

_after setup_

1. prompt
2. watch changes
3. reflect on changes and why it's better/worse or none at all

I want this to end with the feeling that the work has shifted from writing code to reviewing it, which is fine by me because I review A LOT of code.
Also I will learn how to use prompts effectively because those tokens aren't cheap.
